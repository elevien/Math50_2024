This schedule is subject to changes throughout the course at my discretion. Readings will be finalized the friday before they are covered in class.
For the readings, ER means  

*  **Week 1: Discrete Probability and Monte Carlo Simulations**
   * Topcs:
     * Familiarity with basic concepts in probability (events, probability distribution, conditioning, means, variances)
     * Basics of python programming (arrays, Dataframes, plotting)
     * The concept of Monte Carlo simulation
   * Reading: 
     * ER: 1.1,1.2,1.3(skim),1.5.1,2.1 and 2.3 (Examples 2.3.3 and 2.3.4),2.8
       * Note: There is a lot of material in these chapters that I won't cover in detial, refer to the notes for specific definitions and Theorems. The most important concept is conditional probability (1.5)
     * ISP: 2.3
       * Note: I use ``np.random`` instead of ``np.random.default_rng``
   * Assignments due: Python tutorial
  
* **Week 2: iid Sums, Binomial and CLT**
  * Topcs: 
    * Expectations and variances
